  "message": "## Description:\nThe rabbitmq heartbeat has failed for the rabbitmq deployment.\n\n\n## Escalation Path:\ngetrabbitnow@cfoundry.pagerduty.com\n\n\n## Possible Causes: \nSometimes, when rabbit crashes, monit restarts the process. However, just starting epmd doesn't make the rabbit server participate in the cluster. What is needed is to run `rabbitmqctl start_app.` At this point, monit is happy and rabbitmq is 'running.' However, it is not actually running, and must have 'rabbitmqctl' started.\n\n## Potential Solutions:\n Log into each rabbitmq server and run `rabbitmqctl status`. If there are only a couple of started jobs, then this server is not participating in the cluster. Run `rabbitmqctl start_app`. Run `rabbitmqctl status` again, and compare the output. \n\nThere are notes in the `operator_notes/` folder of the environment repo: how to connect, useful RabbitMQ commands, and how to alert the client. \n\n##Feedback:\n Have feedback for this alert?
